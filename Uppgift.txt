Uppgift
Ladda ner "07_ConveyorsAndDoor.smk" och designa ett program i CoDeSys som uppfyller funktionsbeskrivningen (Workflow) nedan. Använd programspråket sequential function chart (SFC).
System description:
The conveyors are commanded with motor contactors using output signals Conv1MotorFwd and Conv2MotorFwd. One sensor is placed on the first conveyor so dropped boxes are directly detected and two sensors are placed before and after the door. The sensors are connected to Sensor1, Sensor2 and Sensor3 PLC inputs respectively.

The door in between the conveyors is commanded with a reversing contactor. DoorMotorFwd and DoorMotorRev PLC outputs are connected to the contactor to open and close the door respectively. The door has two sensors connected to SensorClose and SensorOpen inputs to know when the door is completely closed and open. A Light beacon is places on the side of the door connected to output Light.

Workflow:
Once a box is dropped the first conveyor runs forward until a box is detected by the sensor before the door. Then the door should open to avoid collision and the box continues to the end of the second conveyor. Once there, the door is closed and the box can be removed. During the time the door is not closed, the light should be blinking (0.5s On/0.5s Off).

Leverans
Programmet designas i CoDeSys och du laddar upp programfilen enligt syntax:

"ditt efternamn, ditt förnamn, uppgift 14.project"

Ex: "Jansson, Jan uppgift14.project"

Obs! CoDeSys skapar filer i projektmappen. Se till att du väljer rätt fil bland dessa.
